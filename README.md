# xml-to-csv

I need to convert a large XML file of Nowergian pharmaceutical product data (roughly 100mb) to a csv format that can be imported to other tools. You will need to identify the headers for the clustered information, and then write a script to run through the XML data and output the csv

Please provide the completed csv and script as the final deliverable.

You can view the XML here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18_2fBxKpOSsrunVJh1y5emcWalK-pXL1/view?usp=sharing
